This is a Final Year Project (FYP) from my Bachelor in Information Technology studies. 📚🎓 
This project is called Central Data Management for International Office (CDMIO). 🌐 
Unfortunately, this is not the final version of the project as my M.2 SSD broke, and I could not recover the files. 💔
This version is a backup from a hard drive I had. 💾 I have no intention of finishing this project again until further notice. 🚫
